## Ground Truth
This sub-directory matches the Section IV-C of the corresponding paper.  
"groundtruth.txt" is the libraries that we extracted from the 1000 sample apps manually.  
Folder "/libD" contains the total libraries that LibD has found in the 1,000 samples and comparison result with the groundtruth.  
Folder "/libRadar" contains the total libraries that LibRadar has found in the 1,000 samples and the comparison result with the groundtruth.
